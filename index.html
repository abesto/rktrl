<h3>What is this?</h3>

<p>
A roguelike game I'm building by following along the outstanding tutorial at
<a href="https://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/rustbook/">https://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/rustbook/</a>
and tweaking things as I go.
</p>

<p>
It's also Rust compiled to WASM, which is pretty amazing.
</p>

<h3>Fine, what can I do?</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Move around with the VI keys, or arrows, or the numpad</li>
    <li>Hit monsters by walking into them</li>
    <li>Pick up items with <code>g</code></li>
    <li>Open your inventory with <code>i</code> to pick an item to use. Ranged targeting happens with the mouse.</li>
    <li>Pick an item to drop with <code>d</code></li>
    <li>Hover over things with your mouse for a tooltip</li>
</ul>
